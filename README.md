# Dog-Breed-Classification-with-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
```Project Overview:```

This project aims to classify images of dog breeds using two different approaches - a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning. The Stanford Dog Breed dataset is used for training and evaluating the models. The goal is to compare the performance of the two models on the test set and determine which approach yields better results.

```Dataset:```

The Stanford Dog Breed dataset contains images of 120 dog breeds, with a total of around 20,000 images. Each image is labeled with its corresponding dog breed. The dataset is divided into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and properly organized before running the scripts.



```Requirements:```

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose the framework for your models)
Necessary libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
Usage:

Make sure you have all the requirements mentioned above installed.



Results:

The results obtained from the evaluation will be displayed, comparing the performance of the traditional CNN and the transfer learning model. You will be able to identify which model performs better on the given task of dog breed classification.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the implementation of two different models for classifying dog breeds. It highlights the advantages of using transfer learning over traditional CNNs and provides valuable insights into their respective performances. The results can be leveraged to make informed decisions when choosing the appropriate model for similar image classification tasks.
