# Dog-Breed-Classification-with-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
Project Overview:

This project aims to classify images of dog breeds using two different approaches - a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning. The Stanford Dog Breed dataset is used for training and evaluating the models. The goal is to compare the performance of the two models on the test set and determine which approach yields better results.

Dataset:

The Stanford Dog Breed dataset contains images of 120 dog breeds, with a total of around 20,000 images. Each image is labeled with its corresponding dog breed. The dataset is divided into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and properly organized before running the scripts.

Project Structure:

The project has the following structure:

data/: This directory contains the Stanford Dog Breed dataset. It is further divided into 'train', 'val', and 'test' subdirectories, each containing images of their respective sets.

normal_cnn_model.py: This script implements a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for dog breed classification. It trains the model on the training set, validates it on the validation set, and evaluates it on the test set.

transfer_learning_model.py: This script utilizes transfer learning to build a powerful dog breed classifier. It uses a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.) and fine-tunes it on the Stanford Dog Breed dataset. The model is trained, validated, and tested on respective sets.

evaluate_performance.py: This script calculates and compares the performance of both models on the test set. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed and displayed.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose the framework for your models)
Necessary libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
Usage:

Make sure you have all the requirements mentioned above installed.

Download the Stanford Dog Breed dataset and place it in the 'data/' directory, following the folder structure mentioned above.

Run the normal_cnn_model.py script to train and evaluate the traditional CNN model.

Run the transfer_learning_model.py script to fine-tune a pre-trained model on the dog breed dataset.

Finally, execute the evaluate_performance.py script to compare the performance of both models on the test set.

Results:

The results obtained from the evaluation will be displayed, comparing the performance of the traditional CNN and the transfer learning model. You will be able to identify which model performs better on the given task of dog breed classification.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the implementation of two different models for classifying dog breeds. It highlights the advantages of using transfer learning over traditional CNNs and provides valuable insights into their respective performances. The results can be leveraged to make informed decisions when choosing the appropriate model for similar image classification tasks.
